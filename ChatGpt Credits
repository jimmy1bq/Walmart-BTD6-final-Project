Here substring explation in unity by chatGpt(I was trying to find out how to fix my substring because substring(2,2) of "012" wasn't working but substring(1,1) was working. So I decided to guess and landed on the solution of substring(2). Which was intersting so i decided to lookup the documentation and notice it said length instead of substring. So i decided to ask gpt about this.).
